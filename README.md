Aprendiendo del Evangelio
This project is a simple, interactive web page designed to teach three fundamental principles for receiving spiritual knowledge. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging, bilingual user experience.

Features

Interactive Cards: Three interactive cards represent the core principles. Clicking on a card reveals more detailed information and a link to a related resource.

Progress Tracker: A dynamic progress bar fills up as the user interacts with each card, providing visual feedback on their progress.

Completion Message: Once all three cards are clicked, a celebratory message appears, confirming the user has completed the learning journey.

Visual Design: The design is clean and inviting, with custom fonts from Google Fonts, icons from Font Awesome, and a CSS-based sticker effect for a playful touch.
