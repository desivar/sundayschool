 Aprendiendo del Evangelio
This is a simple, interactive web page designed to teach three fundamental principles for receiving spiritual knowledge. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging, bilingual user experience.

üåü Features
Bilingual Support: The page is fully functional in both Spanish and English, allowing users to toggle between languages with a single click.

Interactive Cards: Three interactive cards represent core principles. Clicking on a card reveals more detailed information and a link to a related resource from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Progress Tracker: A dynamic progress bar fills up as the user interacts with each card, providing a visual cue for their progress.

Completion Message: Once all three cards are clicked, a celebratory message appears with a special effect, confirming the user has completed the learning journey.

Visually Engaging Design: The design is clean and inviting, with custom fonts, icons, and a CSS-based sticker effect for a playful touch.
